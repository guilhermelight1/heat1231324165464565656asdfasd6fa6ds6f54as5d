Experimental chart made as a DataVizRequest from this Reddit thread:
https://www.reddit.com/r/DataVizRequests/comments/ac3x0q/request_can_someone_volunteer_their_time_to/

Dataset was from the user's grandfather who manually charted the rain levels in Earlville, Cairns, Australia from 1993 to today.
Went with the theme and thought I would experiment by making a 3d radial line chart, hoping for it to look like a raindrop splash.
The end result sort of has the effect I wanted, but gives no extra insight that a series of layered line charts wouldn't give.
In the end, happy with my prototype and curious to see if it would work better with other sets of data in the future.
